Cucumber:
Cucumber is a command-line tool. When you run it, it reads in your specifi- cations from plain-language text files called features, examines them for scenarios to test, and runs the scenarios against your system. Each scenario is a list of steps for Cucumber to work through. So that Cucumber can under- stand these feature files, they must follow some basic syntax rules. The name for this set of rules is Gherkin.

Gherkin
Cucumber tests are expressed using a syntax called Gherkin. Gherkin files are plain text and have a .feature extension.
